# Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer

#### This is an analysis of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset available on UCI here.  The analysis is suggested in Chapter 3 of *Machine Learning with R* by Brett Lantz.

The objective is to use kNN classifiers to determine whether breast tumors are benign or malignant.  Different values of k are explored, along with the effects of different scalers.  

Precision, recall, and F-score are all used as metrics, though F-score is used as the single metric to determine the optimal parameters.

The analysis is implemented in Python and uses the following packages: sklearn, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
